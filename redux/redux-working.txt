Redux is a **state management library** often used in React applications to manage **global or shared state** in a predictable and centralized way.

---

## 🔧 **Why Redux?**

In larger apps:

* Passing props becomes messy (`prop drilling`)
* Many components may need access to the same data (e.g. user, cart, theme)
* You need a **single source of truth** with clear state flow

---

## ⚙️ Core Concepts of Redux

Redux follows the **unidirectional data flow** pattern:

> `UI → dispatch(action) → reducer → update store → notify components`

---

### 🧱 1. **Store**

The **store** is the centralized container that holds the **entire state tree** of your application.

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import userReducer from './userSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    user: userReducer,
  }
});
```

---

### 📦 2. **State**

Redux manages application **state** in a single JS object (or tree).

```js
{
  user: { name: 'John', loggedIn: true },
  cart: { items: [...] },
  theme: 'dark'
}
```

---

### 🏷️ 3. **Actions**

Actions are **plain JS objects** describing what happened.

```js
const loginAction = {
  type: 'user/login',
  payload: { name: 'John' }
};
```

Used to **initiate a state change**.

---

### 🧠 4. **Reducer**

A pure function that **receives state and action** and returns the **new state**.

```js
function userReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'user/login':
      return { ...state, user: action.payload, loggedIn: true };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

> Reducers must be pure and never mutate state directly.

---

### 📡 5. **Dispatch**

To change state, components **dispatch** actions.

```js
dispatch({ type: 'user/login', payload: { name: 'John' } });
```

---

### 👂 6. **Selectors (optional)**

Used to **read data from state**.

```js
const user = useSelector((state) => state.user);
```

---

### 📲 7. **Provider**

Wrap your app with `<Provider store={store}>` so all components can access the Redux store.

```js
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { store } from './store';

<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

---

## ✅ Redux Toolkit (RTK)

Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux:

* Pre-configures the store
* Uses `createSlice` to auto-generate reducers & actions
* Great DX for async and large projects

---

### 🧩 RTK Example

#### `userSlice.js`

```js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'user',
  initialState: { name: '', loggedIn: false },
  reducers: {
    login: (state, action) => {
      state.name = action.payload.name;
      state.loggedIn = true;
    },
    logout: (state) => {
      state.name = '';
      state.loggedIn = false;
    }
  }
});

export const { login, logout } = userSlice.actions;
export default userSlice.reducer;
```

---

#### `App.jsx`

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { login, logout } from './userSlice';

function App() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const user = useSelector((state) => state.user);

  return (
    <div>
      {user.loggedIn ? (
        <>
          <h2>Welcome {user.name}</h2>
          <button onClick={() => dispatch(logout())}>Logout</button>
        </>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => dispatch(login({ name: 'John' }))}>Login</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🔁 Redux Data Flow (Visual)

```
[UI Component]
     |
 dispatch(action)
     ↓
[Middleware (optional like thunk)]
     ↓
   Reducer
     ↓
  Store (updated)
     ↓
[React Components re-render]
```

## 🧠 Summary

| Component    | Role                                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Store**    | Holds app state                        |
| **Action**   | Describes what happened                |
| **Reducer**  | Returns new state based on action      |
| **Dispatch** | Sends an action                        |
| **Selector** | Reads state from store                 |
| **Provider** | Makes Redux store available to the app |
