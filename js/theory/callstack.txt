Great! Let’s dive deep into the **order of execution in JavaScript’s Call Stack** and understand the **core components of the JavaScript Engine** (like V8, SpiderMonkey).

## 🧠 What is the **JavaScript Engine**?

A **JavaScript engine** is a program (like **V8 in Chrome**, **SpiderMonkey in Firefox**) that:

* Parses JS code
* Compiles it
* Executes it efficiently

## 🔧 Core Components of a JS Engine

| Component             | Role                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory Heap**       | Stores objects, functions — like RAM for JS                          |
| **Call Stack**        | Keeps track of function calls in LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order      |
| **Execution Context** | The environment in which code runs (global or function scope)        |
| **Event Queue**       | Stores async tasks (e.g. setTimeout, fetch) until the stack is clear |
| **Web APIs**          | Browser-provided (not part of engine): timers, DOM, fetch etc.       |
| **Microtask Queue**   | Stores promises and mutations (runs before task queue)               |

## 📊 Order of Execution — **Call Stack in Action**

### 💡 Simple Sync Example:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log('Hello');
}
function welcome() {
  greet();
  console.log('Welcome');
}
welcome();
```

### 📌 Call Stack Order:

```
1. global()
2. welcome()
3. greet()
4. console.log('Hello')
5. console.log('Welcome')
```

The **last called is the first executed**, and it's **popped** after execution.

---

## ⏱️ Now with Async:

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timer done");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Microtask"));

console.log("End");
```

### ✅ Order of Output:

```
Start
End
Microtask
Timer done
```

### 📌 Execution Breakdown:

| Step                                                                  | Action |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| ✅ `Start` → goes to call stack, logs immediately                      |        |
| ✅ `setTimeout` → sent to Web APIs, callback pushed to **event queue** |        |
| ✅ `Promise.then()` → goes to **microtask queue**                      |        |
| ✅ `End` → logs                                                        |        |
| 🧠 Event loop: Stack is empty → runs **microtasks first**             |        |
| 🧠 Then runs **macrotasks** (event queue — setTimeout)                |        |

---

## 🎯 Event Loop Priorities:

```
1. Call Stack (runs immediately)
2. Microtask Queue (Promises, MutationObserver)
3. Task Queue (setTimeout, setInterval, I/O)
```

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts to Remember:

| Term                  | Meaning                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Call Stack**        | Tracks where you are in code execution                  |
| **Execution Context** | Created for every function call (has `this`, variables) |
| **Heap**              | Long-term memory, objects & closures live here          |
| **Web APIs**          | Browser provided (setTimeout, DOM, fetch etc.)          |
| **Microtasks**        | Promise `.then`, async/await — run before macrotasks    |
| **Event Loop**        | Handles task scheduling when stack is empty             |

---

## 🔁 Recap with Visual Order:

```
JS Code
 ↓
Call Stack
 ↓
Web APIs (setTimeout, fetch, DOM events)
 ↓
Callback queues (Microtask → Macrotask)
 ↓
Event Loop (picks from queue when stack is empty)
 ↓
Back to Call Stack
```
