That‚Äôs a solid goal. Mastering the **core fundamentals of AngularJS** (the 1.x version) requires a project-based approach ‚Äî small, focused apps that help you deeply understand concepts like controllers, services, directives, two-way data binding, routing, and dependency injection.

Here‚Äôs a list of **progressive small learning applications** you can build, each designed to reinforce core AngularJS concepts:

---

### üî∞ **Beginner Level (Basics of AngularJS)**

#### 1. **Todo List App**

* **Concepts:** ng-model, ng-repeat, ng-click, data binding, simple controllers.
* **Features:**

  * Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
  * Filter tasks (all, active, completed).

#### 2. **Simple Calculator**

* **Concepts:** Data binding, controller logic, expressions.
* **Features:**

  * Perform basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

#### 3. **Live Character Counter**

* **Concepts:** ng-model, real-time data binding.
* **Features:**

  * Text area input with a live character/word count below.

### üß∞ **Intermediate Level (Modularity, Services, Routing)**

#### 4. **Contact Book / Address Book**

* **Concepts:** Controllers, services, forms, ng-repeat, CRUD.
* **Features:**

  * Add, edit, delete contacts.
  * Store data in a service or use localStorage.

#### 5. **Weather App (using API)**

* **Concepts:** `$http`, services, data binding, async handling.
* **Features:**

  * Enter a city name to fetch and display weather using an open API like OpenWeatherMap.

#### 6. **User Authentication (Fake Login)**

* **Concepts:** Routing, controllers, services, conditional rendering.
* **Features:**

  * Login page that checks static credentials.
  * Redirects to dashboard on success.
  * Logout functionality.

#### 7. **Notes App**

* **Concepts:** CRUD, filters, localStorage.
* **Features:**

  * Create, edit, delete notes.
  * Persist them in browser storage.

### üß† **Advanced Level (Custom Directives, Filters, Routing, Dependency Injection)**

#### 8. **Custom Modal/Popup Component**

* **Concepts:** Custom directives, transclusion.
* **Features:**

  * Reusable modal with open/close behavior and content injection.

#### 9. **Mini E-Commerce App**

* **Concepts:** Routing, services, filters, directives, cart management.
* **Features:**

  * Product listing.
  * Add to cart.
  * Cart page with total amount.

#### 10. **Blog Platform (Mock)**

* **Concepts:** Routing, nested views, `$http`, templates.
* **Features:**

  * List of blog posts (fake API or static data).
  * Post details page.
  * New post form.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Bonus Tools to Use**

* **Mock APIs:** Use [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) or create your own with [Mocky](https://mocky.io/).
* **Local Storage:** For persistence without backend.
* **Bootstrap or Materialize:** For UI styling, helps keep focus on AngularJS logic.

### üìö Tips for Mastery

* **Master `$scope` vs `controllerAs` syntax.**
* **Practice creating and using `services` for data management.**
* **Write your own `custom directives`.**
* **Use `$http` and learn how to handle promises.**
* **Implement `ngRoute` or `ui-router` for single-page apps.**
* **Understand AngularJS‚Äôs digest cycle and two-way binding.**
